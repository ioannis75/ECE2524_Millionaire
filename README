Documentation:
The game works very similar to the TV show.
There are 15 rounds worth of questions and you can win some fake money.
After you have reached certain levels, you can walk away with a set amount of money.
You get one Lifeline which will get rid of half the answer choices.

Install:
Switch to the directory where you stored this repository.
Type the following commands into the command line:
'make Makefile all'
'chmod +x main'
'./main'

It will then ask you if you want to play Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
Type 'yes' and begin playing the game.

Implementation:
There is a questions file which anyone can modify and add questions too.

It follows a format like this:
Question
Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
Choice D
Answer

The game looks at that pool and grabs 15 random questions and stores that into a list.
Then the game begins!
