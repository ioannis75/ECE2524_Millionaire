This will be a game written in mainly C++ that will be similar to the popular game TV Show - Who wants to be a millionaire?

Documentation:
The game works very similar to the TV show.
There are 15 rounds worth of questions and you can win some fake money.
After you have reached certain levels, you can walk away with a set amount of money.
You get one Lifeline which will get rid of half the answer choices.

Implementation:
There is a questions file which anyone can modify and add questions too.

It follows a format like this:
Question
Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
Choice D
Answer

The game looks at that pool and grabs 15 random questions and stores that into a list.
Then the game begins!
